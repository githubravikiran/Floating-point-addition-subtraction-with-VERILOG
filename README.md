# Floating-point-addition-subtraction-with-VERILOG
The process of adding or subtracting the floating number in binary is done in Verilog HDL. The operation process and flow is made with the IEEE format of floating binary addition and subtraction.
The operands is of 32 bits each and 32nd(MSB) is the sign of the operand, next 8 MSB is the exponent component and the next 23 is the mantissa. The mantissa is shifted according to the changes made in the exponent component. This is a crucial step in floating-point arithmetic known as exponent alignment. The exponent of the smaller number is adjusted to match the exponent of the larger number, and its mantissa is shifted right by the difference in the exponents.

After the exponents are aligned, the mantissas are added or subtracted based on the sign bits of the two operands and the specific operation (addition or subtraction) being performed. The result of this operation may need to be normalized. This involves shifting the resulting mantissa and adjusting the exponent so that the most significant bit of the mantissa is '1'.

Finally, the result must be rounded to fit within the 23-bit mantissa field of the IEEE 754 standard. Different rounding modes can be implemented (e.g., round to nearest, round toward zero). The sign bit of the final result is determined by the signs of the operands and the result of the mantissa addition/subtraction. The final 32-bit floating-point number is then assembled from the sign, the normalized exponent, and the rounded mantissa. The Verilog module will implement this entire pipeline, handling each step from operand parsing to the final output.
